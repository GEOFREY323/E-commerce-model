This is an end_to_end project model for  people in the business domain. It is able to detect whether a website visitor will complete a purchase or not by checking his revenue.A KNN(Knearest neighbors) model is trained to determine whether a website visitor will purchase a good or not

# Problem description

E-commerce businesses collect massive amounts of behavioral data about customer interactions: pages visited, time spent, bounce rates, and more. The challenge is making sense of this data to predict purchasing intent. 
business people will mostly encounter many people visiting their website but have limited idea of whether this people visit to buy or for different intension. This has greatly ruin many businesses leading to problems in predicting whether whos is actually visiting to purchase a product or for different reasons

#Solution approach
 A KNN model has been built to be able to check whether an online user will purchase a product a not by using only his/her revenue. the model is tained with a KNN classifier and its greatly accurate.

 the data set for this mode is present in this repository
